Lambda, public by default, is Function as a Service (FaaS) which is fast and focused. Functions use a runtime chosen by the user (Python 3.8 for example) and a direct allocation of memory (CPU indirect). 

> 1. upload code 
> 2. set trigger from event source
> 3. code runs when triggered
> 4. pay for compute time 

Every year 1 million free requests for ever. 
Each Lambda function timeouts after 900 seconds (15 min). 
The function assumes an IAM role called an execution role. 
Lambda networks the same way as other resources in a VPC. 
Lambda can send events to different destinations.

Lambda can be invoked in 3 ways:

1. Synchronous
> CLI / API invoke a function, pass in data and WAIT
> Lambda responds with data or fails 
> usually done by a human
> retries are ordered by the client

2. Asynchronous
> an event is generated by a service and forgotten 
> if fails, lambda retries between 0 and 2 times (configurable)

3. Event Source Mapping
> used with services that don't generate events (streams or queues for example)
> batches are generated (careful that the batch takes less that 900 seconds to process)
