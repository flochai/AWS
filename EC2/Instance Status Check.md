Two checks are done at the boot of the instance: 

1. System Status
	- Loss of power
	- loss of network connectivity
	- host software issues
	- host hardware issues

2. Instance Status
	- Corrupted file system
	- OS Kernel issues
	- instance networking issues 

You can set up auto-recovery by putting in place an alarm and recover action.
