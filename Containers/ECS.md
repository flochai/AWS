The Elastic Container Service is used to run containers in EC2 mode or [[Fargate]] mode. 
The container definition includes: 

1. Task Definition
2. Task Role (security: this is an IAM role that says what resources can be accessed)

The service wrapper allows us to deploy multiple container definitions.
