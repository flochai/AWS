#Amazon 

AWS MQ is an open-source message broker based on Apache ActiveMQ that is an industry standard. It provides queues and topics in message broker servers (single instance or HA pair). This is not a public service like SNS and SQS as it runs directly in a VPC so proper networking needs to be implemented. MQ is generally used when there is an existing system migration.
