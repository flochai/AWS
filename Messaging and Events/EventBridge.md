EventBridge, which is considered as [[CloudWatch Events]] v2, allows us do an action at a specified time or when an event happens. Each AWS account has an event bus which sends events to different targets. It is possible to create more event busses in EventBridge. 

Rules that are linked to specific events busses are created to filter the events and route them to the correct destination. There are event pattern rules and schedule rules (match cron formatting).
