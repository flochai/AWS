Data Firehose is a serverless, resilient service that scales automatically and allows the delivery of data from Kinesis or producers to supported destinations such as [[S3]]. It offers <span class="red-text">near real time</span> delivery for every 1MB of data or after the buffer interval of 60 seconds. Data can be processed and transformed by Lambda using blueprints. 

Valid Destinations: 

- HTTP endpoints
- splunk
- redshift
- elastic search
- S3
