Simple Notification Service is a regional public AWS service that coordinates the sending and delivery of messages that are max 256KB payloads. 
SNS Topics are where the permissions and configuration are defined. Topics can have subscribers that receive the messages of that topic. 

Topic policies are resource policies that allow us to define who has access to the topic.
