#Amazon 

Delay queues allows us to configure a DelaySeconds value which makes the messages invisible for that duration when they are added to the queue. 

The default value is 0 which means the queue is not a delay queue and the max is 15 minutes. Per-Message Invisibility is not supported on FIFO queues.
