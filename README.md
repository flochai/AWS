# AWS Solutions Architect Associate (SAA) – Obsidian Notes

This repository contains my **personal Obsidian notes** created while preparing for the **AWS Solutions Architect Associate (SAA) exam**.

## About the Notes
- These notes were built while following **Adrian Cantrill's** and **Stéphane Maarek's AWS Solutions Architect Associate courses**, which are both excellent in their own ways.
  - Adrian Cantrill's course is incredibly **visual and deep**, with detailed diagrams that truly explain AWS concepts.
  - Stéphane Maarek's course is **exam-focused and concise**, which is great for reinforcing key topics and practicing for the exam.
- Some **screenshots from Adrian’s course** are included, as his diagrams are extremely useful for visualizing AWS architectures.
- The notes are structured and formatted specifically for **[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)**. All **internal links between files** and **links at the bottom of the notes** are preserved, so when you import this repo as a vault into Obsidian, everything will be automatically connected and configured.

## Content
- Topics include EC2, S3, VPC, IAM, CloudFront, Lambda, API Gateway, RDS, Route 53, and more.
- Visual references, key exam points, and architecture diagrams are integrated for fast reviews.
