CloudFormation is used to automate the creation, updating and deleting of resources with [[CFN Templates]] (YAML / JSON). It is similar to Terraform but exclusive to AWS. 

Once CFN has the template, it creates a stack of logical resources that will then create physical resources that match the logical resources.

You can apply the same template multiple times, in different regions.
