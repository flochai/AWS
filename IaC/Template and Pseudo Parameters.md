Templates can be configured with: 

- defaults
- AllowedValues
- Min / Max
- AllowedPatterns
- NoEcho (doesn't show passwords for example)
- Type

When there are several choices, you have to make a choice when the stack is being created in a console menu. 

A pseudo parameter is like a placeholder. For example *AWS::Region* is a pseudo parameter that will match the region where the stack is being created in. This allows for the creation of portable templates.
