#Amazon 

This is a feature of [[Flo/3_Areas/AWS/Networking/CloudFront|CloudFront]] that allows to run lightweight Lambda in [[Edge Locations]]. There are a few limitations:

- only Node.js and python
- runs in the public AWS space so can't access VPC resources
- layers are not supported
- not the same as normal Lambda functions
