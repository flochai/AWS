#Amazon 

You can create an organization with a standard AWS account that becomes a management account (previously master account). There can only be one. 

Using the unique management account, you can invite other standard accounts to become part of the organisation and become member accounts. It is also possible to create accounts directly in the organisation. 

The billing method of member accounts will be deleted, the management account becomes the payer for all the accounts in what is called consolidated billing. This also means that the organisation can have access to cheaper prices because of volume.
 
The organisation can be divided into containers such as an organization root which is the top level and organizational units (OU).
