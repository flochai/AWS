The 200+ Edge locations are located in many more places than regions which allows for lower latency because they are closer to the customers. They usually are a few server racks in a third party data center. This is useful for services such as Netflix that need speed and have clients everywhere. 

Regional Edge Caches are larger versions of Edge Locations that provide an additional layer of caching.
