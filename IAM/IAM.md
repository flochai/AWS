Identity and Access Management (IAM) is not region dependent, it is free and global. It has 3 missions:

1. ID Manager
2. Authentification
3. Authorization  (allow or deny)


[[IAM Policies]]
[[IAM Users]]
[[IAM Groups]]
[[IAM Roles]]
[[Organizations]]
[[IAM Access Keys]]

### Tips

- don't create role names for IAM users: only real names (for accountability)
- Use root account as less as possible. 
- passwords are optional
