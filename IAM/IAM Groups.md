#Amazon 


- IAM Groups are collections of related users like finance, HR, devs, etc that make managing users easier.  This is not a true identity, it can't be referenced. 
- You can't login to a group and there are no credentials. 
- A user can be in several groups (max 10 per users). 
- There are no native all users group but you can create it yourself. 
- There is a limit of 300 user groups per account but this can be changed with a support ticket.
