#Amazon 

Object versioning starts off as disabled and *cannot go back to disabled* once it has been enabled. The bucket can be suspended and moved back to enabled. 

You can store multiple versions of an object inside a bucket. If versioning is enabled, the id metadata is also enabled for this object representing the version number. 

Versioning can significantly influence cost.
