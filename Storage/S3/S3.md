#Amazon 

Simple Storage Service is <span class="red-text">regionally resilient</span>, the data is replicated across the AZ of that region. It stores objects (5Tb max) in buckets in the AWS Public zone for multi-users.

Objects are composed of a key, which is like the file name, and the value, the data. Objects can't be modified (immutable), only created and deleted.

A bucket name needs to be *globally* unique. They can hold an unlimited number of objects. There is no file system, everything is stored at the root level in this container. There are no folders, they are emulated as objects. 

	soft limit of 100 buckets per account (you can ask support for more)
	hard limit of 1000 buckets per account

S3 can't be mounted.
