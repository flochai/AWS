#Amazon 

Transfer Acceleration is an on / off feature that allows the data to transit through the closest [[Edge Locations]] which means that the path the data takes will be dictated by Amazon instead of the public internet which usually chooses the most economically viable path instead of the fastest one. 

This means that long distance transfers can be significantly faster using this service. 

Tip: The bucket name can't have a period in it.
