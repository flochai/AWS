CloudFormation is used to automate the creation, updating and deleting of resources with [[CFN Templates]] (YAML / JSON). It is similar to [[Terraform]] but exclusive to AWS. 

Once CFN has the template, it creates a stack of logical resources that will then create physical resources that match the logical resources. 

You can apply the same template multiple times, in different regions.
