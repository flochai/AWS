#Amazon 


You define your own virtual private clouds in a region. These networks are isolated by default. 

> You can only have **ONE** premade [[default VPC]] per region but many flexible custom VPCs. 

Each VPCs is allocated a range of IPs called the VPC CIDR. 


[[Subnets]] are portions of VPCs
	expose by an internet gateway
	no traffic by default 
	can be public or private
