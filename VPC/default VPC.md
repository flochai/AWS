#Amazon 

- only one per region
- They are preconfigured in a specific way:
	- always the same unique CIDR     --->     172.31.0.0/16
	- one subnet per [[Availability Zones]] of the [[Regions]].

You can delete and recreate this default VPC and it is best practice to leave it active but not to use it because it is not flexible.
