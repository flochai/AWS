DR is a multi-stage plan in case of disaster. 

> Last resort plan

Examples include:
- Regular data back-ups offsite
- Copies of processes and logins 
- stand-by site in case of physical disaster 

DR would be pilot / passenger ejection when a plane is going down. It is the preservation of essential and crucial elements.
