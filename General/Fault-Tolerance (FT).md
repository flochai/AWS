If a system has faults, it needs to continue operating without impacting customers.
This is different from [[High-Availability (HA)]] as FT should be 100% uptime.

	Example: if a plane engine fails, it can't be replaced in flight so the plane has more engines than it needs for fault-tolerance. 


FT is harder to design and costs more than HA.
