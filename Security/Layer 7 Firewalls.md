Normal firewalls (layers 3 and 4) view requests and responses as two different streams of data. Layer 5 adds session capability and the two streams are now seen as one session which reduces admin overhead and permits for better security. These firewalls don't understand anything above their layer of operation so they can't see any headers for http for example (layer 7).

Layer 7 firewalls solve these security gaps by adding capabilities: 

- understanding various layer 7 protocols meaning identification of abnormal elements 
- this allows for the inspection, filtering, tagging and blocking of content
