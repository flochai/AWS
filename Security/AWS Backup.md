Backup is a fully managed data-protection service that allows for backups and restore for different services like EBS, all the databases, EC2, etc. 

This allows us to consolidate data across accounts and regions in one management console. 

- Backup plans can be used to set up frequency, window, lifecycle, vault, region copy.
- Vaults are backup destinations that can be encrypted
- Vault lock is designed for compliance situations, no one can delete data (even AWS)
- On-demand for manual backups
- PITR: Point In Time Recovery
