Macie is a data security and privacy service that is used to discover, monitor and protect data stored in S3 buckets. It can be pointed a buckets and used for the discovery of data such as PII (personal identification information), PHI (personal health information), financial, etc. 

Macie uses managed data identifiers and custom data identifiers that are regex based. 
Discovery jobs are created using one of the above identifier types, a schedule is defined and the service is pointed at buckets. The findings can be viewed via the console or they can be integrated into EventBridge and therefore used with other services.
