The secrets manager and the parameter store are two different products that offer different functionalities although they are similar. 

Secrets Manager is designed for secrets like passwords or API Keys which means it has security features such as automatic rotation using lambda (good with RDS). 
It is designed to be integrated into other applications (SDK's, CLI, API).

Below is an example architecture using Secrets Manager.
