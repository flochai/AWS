A direct connect is a physical connection that can be 1, 10 or 100 Gbps. What the customer is buying is actually a port allocation at a DX location (usually a large data center with an area owned by AWS). It is up to the customer to arrange the physical cable connection to the port. This can take weeks or even months because you need to get the port allocated and then arrange for the cable which doesn't offer resilience because it can be cut. 

Direct connect provides low and consistent latency as well as the highest speeds on AWS.
