There are three types of Elastic Load Balancers in AWS: 

1. Classic Load Balancer (v1 - 2009)
	- 1 SSL per CLB
	- Not really layer 7
	- avoid using it 

2. Application Load Balancer (ALB)
	- layer 7 - https / http / websocket 

3. Network Load Balancer (NLB)
	- TCP / TLS / UDP 
	- if they don't use http(s)
